INFO:Xst:1767 - HDL ADVISOR - Resource sharing has identified that some arithmetic operations in this design can share the same physical resources for reduced device utilization. For improved clock frequency you may try to disable resource sharing.
WARNING:Xst:524 - All outputs of the instance <reg_des> of the block <muxx> are unconnected in block <cpu>.
   This instance will be removed from the design along with all underlying logic
